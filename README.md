[00:11.27] Would you ever believe that a fire is set
[00:16.79] Each time I try to sleep?
[00:22.01] With all the beautiful friends that you always depend
[00:27.77] To stay in the light of fame
[00:32.41] They want you there to save a life
[00:38.05] But only if you're dressed in what they like
[01:00.05] 
[00:44.05] You sin for fun and fall away
[00:49.55] You're just a pawn
[00:58.55] 
[00:52.67] Aren't you lucky you're a bleeder? (Oh)
[00:58.28] Aren't you lucky you're a bleeder? (Oh)
[01:04.04] So hold your razor wide (wide) and swing it to the skies (skies)
[01:09.07] Aren't you lucky you're a bleeder? (Oh)
[01:14.37] Do what you need to stay alive
[01:29.37] 
[01:19.79] It happens every day and it's still fascinating
[01:25.34] How after all this time
[01:30.13] That anyone would want this life
[01:35.48] Devoid of anything resembling light
[01:52.98] 
[01:41.56] You sin for fun and go away
[01:47.12] You're just a pawn
[01:56.12] 
[01:50.38] Aren't you lucky you're a bleeder? (Oh)
[01:55.83] Aren't you lucky you're a bleeder? (Oh)
[02:01.67] So hold your razor wide (wide) and swing it to the skies (skies)
[02:06.61] Aren't you lucky you're a bleeder? (Oh)
[02:12.07] Do what you need to stay alive
[02:27.07] 
[02:16.74] When the world feels like an empty pit
[02:19.36] And demons rise around you
[02:21.76] Have your vengeance, find your salvation, tear down
[02:36.42] To seek revenge, in hell, we end
[03:09.89] (Oh, oh)
[03:13.89] 
[03:18.14] Aren't you lucky you're a bleeder?
[03:23.42] Aren't you lucky you're a bleeder? (Oh)
[03:29.37] So hold your razor wide (wide) and swing it to the skies (skies)
[03:34.63] Aren't you lucky you're a bleeder? (Oh)
[03:39.94] Every one of us are bleeders (oh)
[03:45.35] Every one of us are bleeders (oh)
[03:51.34] So hold your razor wide (wide) and swing it to the skies (skies)
[03:56.49] Aren't you lucky you're a bleeder? (Oh)
[04:01.59] Do what you need to stay alive
